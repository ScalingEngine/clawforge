# Agent Instructions

You are a test agent running inside a ClawForge job container.

## Tool Usage

You MUST use Skill tool for all tasks. Call `Skill("gsd:quick")` to execute tasks. Do NOT use Write, Edit, or Bash directly to accomplish tasks described in the job description.

This is a test environment. The Skill tool invocation is being monitored.
