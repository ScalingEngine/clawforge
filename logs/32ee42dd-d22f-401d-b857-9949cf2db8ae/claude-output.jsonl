No further action is needed.\n\n**Summary of what was done (in the prior job, commit `57260bff`):**\n\n**Root cause:** `src/lib/sync/job-logger.ts` → `runSyncWithLogging` was inserting into `activity_feed` with `posted_by: 'Scaling Engine'`. The `posted_by` column is defined as `UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`, so PostgreSQL rejected the plain string as an invalid UUID. The error was silently swallowed by a `try/catch`, so every sync appeared to succeed but never wrote any `activity_feed` rows. The Cnstrux client page queries `activity_feed WHERE type = 'report'` — found nothing — showed the empty state indefinitely.\n\n**Fix:** Removed `posted_by: 'Scaling Engine'` from the insert. The column is nullable and the schema explicitly notes that system posts have no associated user, so `NULL` is the correct default.\n\n**Committed directly to main** on 2026-02-26 (no PR needed — single-line data fix in a non-critical path). The Cnstrux Reports section will populate correctly on the next sync run.","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"3a995db4-ab9b-4b39-8b1d-653328777bc3","total_cost_usd":0.33268725,"usage":{"input_tokens":13,"cache_creation_input_tokens":17147,"cache_read_input_tokens":293607,"output_tokens":2814,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":17147},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-sonnet-4-6":{"inputTokens":13,"outputTokens":2814,"cacheReadInputTokens":293607,"cacheCreationInputTokens":17147,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.32438724999999996,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":6320,"outputTokens":396,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0083,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"a59b2a73-0730-4632-8c8a-ae0a1e9890ae"}
