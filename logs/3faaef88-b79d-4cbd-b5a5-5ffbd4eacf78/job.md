Target repo: ScalingEngine/neurostory

Find any existing file in the repository and add a comment to it with the text "verified by cross-repo regression test 2". Use the appropriate comment syntax for the file type (e.g., `//` for JS/TS, `#` for Python/shell, `<!-- -->` for HTML/Markdown, etc.). Pick a reasonable file — a source file or config file is fine.

Commit the change with a descriptive commit message like "chore: add cross-repo regression test verification comment".
