Target repo: NoahWessel/NeuroStory

Add today's date (2026-02-25) to the README.md file. Add it in a natural place — either at the top as a "Last Updated" line or at the bottom. If there's already a date or "Last Updated" field, update it. Use the format "Last Updated: February 25, 2026". Commit the change directly to the main branch.
